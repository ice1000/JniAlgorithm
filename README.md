[中文](./README_Zh.md)

This is an algorithm library for Java, whose core is written in C++, linked with JNI.

It is test-driven(also benchmarks), well-documented, with code generation for some special cases.

## Project structure

file name|usage
:---|---:
jni|C++ codes
code_drafts|something written but not used ATM
libjni.dll/libjni.so/libjni.dylib|jni library
jni/cpp-test|C++ tests
src/main/java|source(independent)
src/main/kotlin|Kotlin extension library
src/test|tests

The `jni library` above is not included in the repo,
please build it yourself, or download at:

+ General: [GitHub release](https://github.com/ice1000/algo4j/releases)
+ Windows only: [AppVeyor artifact](https://ci.appveyor.com/project/ice1000/algo4j/build/artifacts)
+ Linux only: [CircleCI](https://circleci.com/gh/ice1000/algo4j) => latest build => artifact page.

Put it to your working directory after download or build one.

## Overview

- [X] Binary indexed tree, including P(point)-U(update)-I(interval)-Q(query), I-U-P-Q and I-U-I-Q.
- [X] Trigonometric functions, including: sin, cos, tan, cot, sec, csc.
- [X] Union set. including path compression and heuristic merge.
- [X] Math utils, including fast power series, primes, fibs, etc.
- [X] Sequence utils, like sorts, discretization, kmp, toString, etc.
- [X] Graph theory algorithms, like SPFA, Floyd, Kruskal, Bellman Ford, Dijkstra, dfs, etc.
- [X] A Win32API interface for windows only, right call something like 'Beep'.
- [X] Linear data structure, Stack and Queue.
- [X] Minimum binary heap(priority queue), support adding and extracting.
- [X] Trie tree, whose key supports ASCII 32-127, as Trie<T> : Map<String, T>.
- [X] Multi-threading quick sort implementation.
- [X] Fast power for big integers.
- [X] Big Integer(plus minus mul div rem), faster(usually) than java.math.BigInteger.
- [X] Segment Tree, multi-implementations.
- [X] Durable Segment Tree, multi-implementations.

Actually, every java classes are well-documented.<br/>
For more information, see JavaDocs in each java file or package-info.java.

## Contribution

There is a [README file](./jni/README.md) under `jni` path, it's strongly-recommended right read that.

This library is Test-driven, so there are tests for every class. If you want to contribute, please offer tests for your classes.

### Rules of contribution

+ Each class should be well-documented.
+ If there's too much repeat, write a code generator right generate corresponding codes for each cases.
+ For C++, you should follow the [code style](./jni/README.md).
+ For each class with native methods, provide a unit-test.
+ I'll write the library itself with Java and tests with Kotlin, but I also accept Tests with other languages.
+ Issues and pull requests are always welcomed.
